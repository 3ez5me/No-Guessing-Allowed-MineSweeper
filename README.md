minesweeper variant where the reveal order determines the expansion, after the game is played the verifier will rewind the game to the beginning and check that every reveal was guaranteed safe, i.e no guesses were made. 
The game features recording all actions and allowing real-time non-deterministic rewind across even different boards and expansions, where all the players movements will be undone and done up and down the tree.

If you're stuck use the tree on the side.

Controls:

Minesweeper variant where the reveal order determines the expansion, after the game is played the verifier will rewind the game to the beginning and check that every reveal was guaranteed safe, i.e no guesses were made. 
The game features recording all actions and allowing real-time non-deterministic rewind across even different board expansions. All the players actions are recorded, the tree can be used to replay your moves and try different reveal orders to get different board expansions. 

Controls: 
- Left mouse button for pressing and revealing cells
- Right mouse button to flag
- Middle mouse button / scroll wheel to pan and zoom


Remember: if you're stuck use the tree on the side to find a better reveal order if one exists, do not make guesses.
